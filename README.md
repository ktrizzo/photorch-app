## üî¨ What does PhoTorch do?

PhoTorch provides an intuitive, interactive platform for fitting widely used plant physiological models, enabling rapid exploration and interpretation of experimental data.


## üöÄ Key Features
- Photosynthesis Model Fitting
  - Fit the full Farquhar-von Caemmerer-Berry (1980) model for:
    - V<sub>cmax25</sub>, J<sub>max25</sub>, TPU<sub>25</sub>, and 16+ others
  - Integrate CO‚ÇÇ (A‚ÄìCi), light response (A‚ÄìQ), and temperature response (A-T) curves
  - Recover Temperature Optima
- Stomatal Conductance Model Fitting
  - Fit multiple empirical and optimization-based models, including:
  	- Ball-Woodrow-Berry (1987)
  	- Medlyn et al. (2011)
  	- Leuning (1995)
  	- Buckley-Turnbull-Adams (2012)
- Pressure‚ÄìVolume (PV) Curve Fitting
  - Analyze water relations data to extract parameters such as:
  	- Osmotic potential at full turgor (œÄ<sub>0</sub>)
  	- Bulk modulus of elasticity (Œµ)
  	- Relative water content at turgor loss point (RWC<sub>tlp</sub>)
- Flexible Data Input
- Accepts .csv, .txt, and .xlsx formats
- Optional rescaling with survey data
- Species-specific analysis and visualization
- Interactive and Visual
- Real-time fitting feedback
- Plotly-based visualization of fit quality
- View RMSE, R¬≤, and residuals for model evaluation


## üß™ Who is it for?

PhoTorch is designed for:
- Field scientists needing a fast way to process LI-600 or LI-6800 data
- Plant ecophysiologists analyzing gas exchange and water relations
- Crop modelers calibrating parameters for predictive models
- Students and educators learning how physiological models work
